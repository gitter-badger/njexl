  Using JEXL expressions in JUnit assertions.

   This package only contains one class, Asserter, which
   allows you to use a JEXL expression in a JUnit assertion.
   The following example demonstrates the use of the Asserter
   class.  An instance is created, and the internal JexlContext
   is populated via calls to setVariable().  Calls to 
   assertExpression() succeed if the expression evaluates to
   the value of the second parameter, otherwise an 
   AssertionFailedException is thrown.
  </p>
  
  <pre>
   Asserter asserter = new Asserter();
   asserter.setVariable("foo", new Foo());
   asserter.setVariable("person", "James");

   asserter.assertExpression("person", "James");
   asserter.assertExpression("size(person)", new Integer(5));
        
   asserter.assertExpression("foo.getCount()", new Integer(5));
   asserter.assertExpression("foo.count", new Integer(5));
  </pre>
