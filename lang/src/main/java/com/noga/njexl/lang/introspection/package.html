        <h2>Provides high-level introspective services.</h2>
        <p>
            The Uberspect, JexlMethod, JexlPropertyGet and JexlPropertySet interfaces
            form the exposed face of introspective services.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Uberspectimpl is the concrete class implementing the Uberspect interface.
            Deriving from this class is the preferred way of augmenting Jexl introspective
            capabilities when special needs to be fullfilled or when default behaviors
            need to be modified.
